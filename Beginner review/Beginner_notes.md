I reviewed all the most basic SQL concepts. It was essentially all review but there were many things I had forgotten. 


KEY MISTAKES:

Tried to query while clicked on the wrong database:
	Make sure to specify the database in the FROM argument to make life easier

Didn’t add a ‘;’ between every query:
	add a ‘;’ between every query


TIPS:

Capitalize commands for clarity.

Use proper spacing for readability even if SQL doesn’t take spacing into consideration 


USE CASES:

Pretty much needed for everything done in SQL
